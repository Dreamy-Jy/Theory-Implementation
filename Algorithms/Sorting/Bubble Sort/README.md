# Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort is Simple O(n<sup>2</sup>) sorting Algorithm.

__Languages Implemented in__
* Java
* C++
* Python

## How it Works
The Bubble Sort sorts the list through a series of comparisons between adjacent item in a list.

Given an list containing *N* items, the algorithm sorts the list by __bubbling<sup>[1]</sup>__ the list *N* times.

__<sup>[1]</sup>__-looping through the  entire length of the array and swapping the current value the loop points to with the value that coming after it if the current value is larger than the value proceeding it.

## Todo
* __Fix__
  * [x] My implementation of this sort does an unnecessary extra iteration.
* __Add__
  * [ ] An optimized version of the bubble sort.
  * A random list generation function to your implementations in:
    * [x] Python
    * [x] C++
* __Implement In__
  - [ ] JavaScript
