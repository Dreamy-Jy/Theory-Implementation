# Insertion Sort

The Insertion Sort is Simple O(n<sup>2</sup>) sorting Algorithm.

## How it Works

* draft 1

Conceptually this algorithm splits the array into a Sorted and Unsorted. The algorithm consumes the unsorted array part of the array element by element. When an element is added to the sorted array it is inserted into the value that makes it sorted. This is done on the entire array.


>Assumption that the sorting condition is from least to greatest

## Todo

* Refactor the Java Implementation:
  - [ ] Make it only use one loop
* Implement this Algorithm in:
  - [ ] C++
  - [ ] JavaScript
  - [ ] Python
