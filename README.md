# Theory Implementation

***

This is a repository containing simple implementations (and possibly a few technical reports) of Computer Science Principles I'm learning/have learnt. I'll try to make all implementation in all the languages I'm functional in at the time of their implementation.

>NOTE:
>This is a living Repo that changes and grows as I grow as a programmer.
>Throughout the additions my coding style will change: but currently I'm
>trying to use [google's style guildes](https://google.github.io/styleguide/), 
>thou I make promises about style uniformity.
