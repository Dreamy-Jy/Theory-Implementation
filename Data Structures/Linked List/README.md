# Linked List

These are a simple implementations of the Linked List Data Structure.

__Languages Implemented in__
* Java

## How It Works

Linked List are a series of **Nodes<sup>[1]</sup>** connected to one another, one after the other.

The connected Nodes don't need to be in a Linked List Object, but we use the Object as a constant reference to important Nodes, like head the first Node, and methods used to manipulate for manipulating the data.

**<sup>[1]</sup>**- A small data structure containing data and zero or more links to other nodes.
- In this case each Node can only contain 1 link to the next Node in the linked list.

## Variables and Methods

*Variables:*
- **Node head** - a reference to the first Node in the Linked List.

*Methods:*
- **void add()** -
- **void reverse()**
